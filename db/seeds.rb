	about: "<p>I am recent graduate of <a href='http://devbootcamp.com/learn-ruby-javascript/overview/'>Dev Bootcamp NYC (Firefly cohort)</a>, a 19 week web development bootcamp program. I'm currently seeking an opportunity to use my Front End and Full Stack Web Development skills in the D.C. area.</p>

  <p>I love dogs, yoga, and science fiction novels. I used to work as a Yoga Assistant at <a href='http://downdogyoga.com/'>Down Dog Yoga</a> in Georgetown and I most recently finished <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_Children_(novel)'>Saturn's Children</a> by Charles Stross.</p>
